# Portfolio Stacker: A FullStack PERN Application

This is a very simple implementation of a react front-end and graphql, express backend.

Application Stack:

- Postgres
- React (NextJS)
- NodeJS
- Express
- ApolloServer (GraphQL)

Just for fun:
- Redux for Global Auth State => I'm considering switching this to Zustand to reduce bundle size

Here's everything this application will include: 

- User Login and Registration
- CRUD Operations
- Permissions
- File Upload 


Here's the problem this application solves:
- Developers want to quickly share their portfolio without setting up a website. This could be used as a simple portfolio page generator.
